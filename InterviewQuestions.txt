AWS:

Types of endpoints :- VPC endpoint, s3 endpoint
----VPC Endpoints: Private connection to public AWS services

Types of VPC endpoints:
----Interface used for (e.g. SNS, SQS, ECR, etc.)
	Gateway: Used for S3 and DynamoDB
	Gateway Load Balancer Endpoints: used for Integrating third-party security appliances (firewalls, packet inspection tools)

S3 bucket policies
Cross account access
—from ec2 instance to s3 bucket
—lambda access from one account to another account ec2 instance(VPC peering)

AWS cognito
----aws cognito user pools -- user db/ help with the identity / log in
----aws cognito identy pools -- once logged in decides the access(this user is allowed to access which resources)

difference between sg and nacl
---level, apply on all or selected , application order, allow & deny,statefull(security groups- 2 way allowed default) & stateless(nacl)

difference between public and private subnet
----Public subnet – The subnet has a direct route to an internet gateway.
					Resources in a public subnet can access the public internet. 
					Resouces have public ip address.
	Private subnet – The subnet does not have a direct route to an internet gateway.
					 Resources in a private subnet require a NAT device to access the public internet.
					 Resouces have only private ip address.

identify with just watching the cidr block whether the subnet is private or public
----In Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), a private subnet is a network within a VPC that doesn't have a direct route to an internet gateway. 
	Resources in a private subnet need a NAT device to access the public internet. 
	10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
	172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255
	192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255

how will you design the vpc and subnet for the 2 tier application. how many subnets?where will you put the load balancer ? where will you put the ec2 instances, in public or private subnt and why?

vpc cidr block will be private or public ip?
----private

what are storage classes in s3 aws
-----S3 Standard
     S3 Intelligent-Tiering*
     S3 Express One Zone**
     S3 Standard-IA(infrequent access)
     S3 One Zone-IA**
     S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
     S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval***
     S3 Glacier Deep Archive**

if the existing vpc is only left with very little ip addresses what will you do.can we add multiple cidrs?
----yes we can add 50 cidrs for one vpc

when to use EC2 and lambda
----EC2 would be preferable when consistent workloads are considerd, access to the servers, etc

How to make the EC2 instance present in the public subnet as private without doing any change in the route table, NACL, security group?
----Detach its public IP

What is ENI and its role?
----The resources which assign the private and public ip address to the EC2 instances or other resources are controlled by the ENI.
When auto assign public IP is enabled, ENI will be having one public IP address.
If we want to detach this public IP from the EC2 instance, select EC2 INSTANCE -> networking -> network interface -> select the ENI -> Manage IP -> Disable the auto assign IP address. 

Time restricted access to s3 object (example:- allow access to the object for 10 mins only)
----presigned url

Types of cloudwatch events
----Scheduled events
	AWS service events
	Custom events
	
S3 bucket object should be deleted after 6 months
----Lifecycle rule

S3 bucket is a global or regional service
----Regional serivce

Can we create a s3 bucket with the same name in different regions
----Amazon S3 bucket names are globally unique — across all AWS accounts and regions.
	Once a bucket name is used (by anyone in the world), you can't reuse it unless that bucket is deleted and the name becomes available.

EC2 instance wants to access objects in the S3 bucket
----EC2 instance in private subnet:
	-----Create VPC endpoint of type Gateway endpoint which will help you in connecting to S3 bucket. VPC endpoint will create private network to make connection from EC2 to S3
	EC2 instance in public subnet:
	----Create a role, attach the required policies and update the bucket policies if required.

Continuous Delivery vs Continuous Deployment
----When code is deployed without any manual intervention after the CI part , it is referred as continuous deployment
----If it's delivered only when it is required, like taking down time from customer and then deploy and then do sanity,etc. Manual intervention is requied.

Kubernetes:

K8S Architecture:
----
	Master Node:
		API Server
		ETCD
		Scheduler
		Controller Manager
		Cloud Controller Manager
	Worker Node:
		Container Runtime
		Kubelet
		Kube-proxy
	
Communication of pod in 2 namespace
----network policies

Live monitoring command for pods
----kubectl get pods -w OR kubectl get pods --watch

Segregating micro service
----Namespace

Challenges :
----Pods in pending state
----Argo cd , terraform race condition

how do you segregate the applications
----Namespace

how do you segregated the pods in the Availability zones
----Pod Topology Spread Constraints

Anti-affinity vs Daemonset
----If I have 10 nodes and 8 pods and want pods to be deployed on different nodes(no 2 same deployment pods on single node), I will go with anti-affinity.
	If I have some applicaton which scraps the metrics, like Prometheous, Dynatrace< will go with the Daemonset, because it will create a pod on every node(10 pods, one on each node)

Probes in Kubernetes
----Liveness :- if output of this probe is 0 its fine, if it's non-zero it restarts the container.This probe determines if a container is still "alive" and functioning as expected. Its primary purpose is to detect deadlocks or other states where an application is running but unable to make progress. If a liveness probe fails, Kubernetes will restart the container, aiming to restore its functionality. This helps ensure the application's availability by recovering from internal errors.
----Readiness :- know when a container is ready to start accepting traffic.This probe determines if a container is ready to accept incoming network traffic. It is crucial for applications that require a certain startup time, dependencies to be met, or specific conditions to be fulfilled before they can serve requests. If a readiness probe fails, Kubernetes will temporarily remove the Pod from the Service's load balancer, preventing new traffic from being routed to it until the probe succeeds again. This ensures that only healthy and fully operational instances receive traffic, preventing requests from being sent to an unready application.
----Startup :- know when a container application has started. If such a probe is configured, liveness and readiness probes do not start until it succeeds, making sure those probes don't interfere with the application startup. This can be used to adopt liveness checks on slow starting containers, avoiding them getting killed by the kubelet before they are up and running. Used to confirm the successful initialization of an application within a container.If a container fails its startup probe, Kubernetes will kill the container according to the pod's restartPolicy. 

	
Secrets vs configmap
----One of the reason is that we can apply granular RBAC to the configmaps.
	Kubernetes treats Secrets as sensitive: enables built-in encryption at rest and secure memory handling.
	ConfigMaps are not designed for sensitive data: they are stored in plaintext in etcd and exposed more openly.
	Secrets have stricter RBAC access control by default.
	Operationally safer: tools and workloads treat Secrets with security in mind (e.g., masking, restricted logs/UI visibility).
	Using Secrets ensures that Kubernetes enforces best practices for handling sensitive data — something ConfigMaps can’t do, even if you encrypt the content yourself.

Observaibility

Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of a system by analyzing the data it produces, including logs, metrics, and traces.

Monitoring(Metrics): involves tracking system metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, and network performance. Provides alerts based on predefined thresholds and conditions

Monitoring tells us what is happening.
Logging(Logs): involves the collection of log data from various components of a system.

Logging explains why it is happening.
Tracing(Traces): involves tracking the flow of a request or transaction as it moves through different services and components within a system.

Tracing shows how it is happening.
